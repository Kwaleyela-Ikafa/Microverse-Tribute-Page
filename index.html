      <div id="tribute-info"><p>Jahseh Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy (January 23, 1998 â€“ June 18, 2018),
          known professionally as XXXTentacion (often stylized as XXXTENTACION) and commonly referred to as simply X,
          was an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. Though a controversial figure due to his widely publicized legal troubles,
          XXXTentacion gained a cult following among his young fanbase during his short career with his depression and alienation-themed music. 
          Critics and fans often credit him for his musical versatility, with his music exploring emo, drill, trap, lo-fi, indie rock, nu metal,
          hip hop, R&B, and punk rock. He is considered to be a leading figure in the emo-rap and SoundCloud rap genres which garnered mainstream attention during the mid-late 2010s.</p>
      <p>On June 18, 2018, XXXTentacion was murdered at the age of 20 when he was fatally shot near a motorcycle dealership in Deerfield Beach, Florida. 
          The attackers fled the scene in an SUV after stealing a Louis Vuitton bag containing $50,000 from him; four suspects were arrested. 
          No trial date has been set for the accused and the motive for the murder remains under investigation.</p>
      <p>XXXTentacion has RIAA-certified sales of 61 million units in the US and BPI-certified sales of over 7 million units in the UK,
           bringing his total to 68 million certified records sold in the two countries. Since his death, he has won an American Music Award and a BET Hip Hop Award
           and received 11 Billboard Music Award nominations. Two posthumous albums were released, Skins (2018) and Bad Vibes Forever (2019); 
           the former became his second number-one album on the Billboard 200 while the latter entered the top 5.</p></div>
